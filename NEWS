version 0.8
- made binned_sum, binned_sumsq and binned_tabulate generic functions (thanks to Gordon An)
- added rbind for ffdf's 
- Fixed bug in ffdfappend appending two ffdf's with a factor, thanks to Milan Bouchet-Valat
- Fixed bug in subset/ffwhich: variables in function body could not be evaluated, thanks to 该走了
- Fixed bug in cut.ff, thanks to Gordon An
- Added rle for ff vectors
- Added function ffseq
- Added S3 methods for ff vectors for generics as.Date, format.
- Allowed chunkify to work with functions returning character vectors also
- Fixed issue when using with.ffdf which returns Date or POSIXct, fixes for table.ff when not all levels where known in 1 chunk

version 0.7
- Fixed bug in ffwhich: variables in expression could not be evaluated, thanks to 该走了

version 0.6-3
- Made sure bigglm.ffdf also works in R version 2.14.2 (reported by Uwe Ligges)
- ffappend now works directly with is.factor.ff instead of is.factor
- BREAKING CHANGE: changed function key to ikey: request of http://code.google.com/p/fffunctions/issues/detail?id=3
- Allowed ikey to work also on an ffdf with only 1 column

version 0.6-2
- Added bigglm.ffdf to allow to fit a bounded memory linear regression model using package biglm
- Removed the overloading of "[.ff" and "[<-.ff" which is causing R crashes due to .Call of C code in package ff directly. Will be put back later on when the reason is cleared out
- Improved implementation of subsetting ff vectors and ffdf data.frames. NA is now handled correctly.

version 0.6-1
- fixed a CRAN check warning for overloading extract functions (thanks to Brian Ripley)

version 0.6
- Added bySum and bySumsq
- Fixed a bug in ffappend for adding factors (this also fixes a bugs in cut.ff)
- Added function key 
- Added function ffifelse
- Added function ffrep.int, ffseq_len 
- Added function expand.ffgrid
- Added as.character.ff
- Allowed table.ff also to work with integers and dates next to factors
- Allowed ffdfdply also to work with integers and dates next to factors in the split
- Overloaded "[.ff" and "[<-.ff" extractor and setter functions from package ff to allow to extract and set elements based on a logical ff vector also instead of only ff integer vectors (this allows to do e.g. ff(1:10)[ff(c(FALSE, TRUE, NA, TRUE))])

version 0.5
- Added Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, ^, %%, %/%) operators for ff vectors
- Added Compare & Logic (==, !=, <, <=, >=, >, &, |, !) operators for ff vectors 
- Added Math (abs, sign, sqrt, ceiling, floor, trunc, log, log10, log2, log1p, acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, exp, expm1, cos, cosh, sin, sinh, tan, tanh, gamma, lgamma, digamma, trigamma, round, signif) functions for ff vectors
- Added ffmatch & ffdfmatch function and overloaded the %in% operator
- Added ffwhich function
- Added laf_to_ffdf
- Added duplicated and unique for ff and ffdf
- Added is.na for ff vectors
- Changed merge.ffdf to work based on ffmatch in order to handle left outer joins correctly
- Fixed a bug in ffwhich.ff_vector
- ffappend and ffdfappend have an extra argument adjustvmode - defaulting to TRUE - which makes sure x is now coerced to a higher vmode if needed. This also affects the c.ff_vector operator.
- improved compact.ff
- Added save.ffdf, move.ffdf, load.ffdf, pack.ffdf and unpack.ffdf

version 0.4-1
- exported sum.ff, because RecordLinkage fails...

version 0.4
- Added many new functions ffdfdply, ffwhich, hist.ff, quantile.ff, cumsum, cummax
- Fixed bugs in 'with.ff' in combination with character and factor vectors.
- Welcomed a new contributer/author Jan Wijffels

version 0.3
- Added ffdfsave function that can be used to save an ffdf data.frame

version 0.2-2
- bug fix, subset for ffdf now works properly (thanks to Martijn Tennekes)

version 0.2-1
- bug fix, sum.ff with na.rm=TRUE is now working correctly (thanks to Andreas Borg)

version 0.2
- initial version
